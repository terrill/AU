<h1>Accessible University: List of Accessibility Problems</h1>

<p>This page summarizes the accessibility problems demonstrated on the Accessible University (AU) home page 
(<a href="before.html">Inaccessible Version)</a>. With each problem, a solution is proposed.  
 To see these accessibility solutions implemented, view the AU Home Page <a href="after.html">Accessible Version</a>.</p>
 
<ol>

<li><span class="label">No headings</span>. Headings and subheadings help organize documents, 
including web pages, so that they are easy to read and understand. Visually, this 
page includes several headings. However, these headings are not marked up explicitly 
as headings using HTML heading tags (e.g., <span class="element">&lt;h1&gt;</span>, <span class="element">&lt;h2&gt;</span>). Instead, they are simply 
marked up as plain text that is bold and large. If HTML heading tags are used, 
screen reader users have access to this structural information. This helps them to gain 
a better understanding of how the document is organized. It also helps with navigation: 
Screen reader users can jump between headings in a document using a single keystroke, 
which is much more efficient than reading the entire page from beginning to end. 
</li>

<li><span class="label">No alternate text on informative images</span>. 
There are several images on this page. Some are decorative, 
but three of the images (the logo and the two photographs) communicate information. 
Whenever an image communicates information, it requires alternate text 
so that users who are unable to see the image have access to its content. 
</li>

<li><span class="label">Missing or excessive alternate text on decorative images</span>. 
Screen reader users do not need access to images whose purpose is solely decorative. 
The example on this page is the horizontal line that appears multiple times on the page. 
The current <span class="attribute">alt</span> attribute for this image is &quot;horizontal line graphic&quot;, 
which is unnecessary information, and can be especially cumbersome to listen to 
when it's repeated multiple times on a page. One solution is to present all 
decorative images as background images in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Another is 
to provide an empty <span class="attribute">alt</span> attribute (<span class="code">alt=&quot;&quot;</span>) for all decorative images. 
This is standard markup that instructs screen readers to ignore the image. 
If the <span class="attribute">alt</span> attribute was missing entirely, screen readers don't know whether the 
image is informative or decorative, so they typically provide information about the image 
(such as the path and filename) in hopes that this will contain information that 
may help the user to understand the image's function and/or content. In a page 
with many decorative images, this can become very cumbersome.</li>

<li><span class="label">Images used to represent text</span>. Whenever possible, it is best to 
present text using text, rather than images. 
Text downloads in a fraction of the time that it takes images to download. 
It is also much easier for web developers to edit plain text content. 
For users who need to enlarge content in order to see it clearly, 
text scales without loss of clarity when enlarged (e.g., using Ctrl + in most Windows browsers, 
or Apple + in Mac browsers). Depending on the browser, images of text 
either do not enlarge at all, or they become pixilated and difficult to read as they get larger. 
</li>

<li><span class="label">Insufficient color contrast</span>. The navigation menu is very difficult 
to see due to the choice of foreground and background colors. Designers should always 
be sure to provide high contrast between the foreground and background colors.</li>
 
<li><p><span class="label">Menu inaccessible to keyboard users</span>. The navigation menu on this page 
is dynamic: Sub-menus appear when users hover over the menus with a mouse.
However, these same menus do not appear for non-mousers. If a user navigates to the menu 
by pressing tab, or using a touch screen or stylus, the sub-menus do not appear; 
nor do the main menu items send the user to a new page. They simply don't work. 
There are many examples of menu systems that have been developed with accessibility in mind. Terrill Thompson, Technology Accessibility Specialist with AccessComputing, examined several of these in depth in his blog post <a href="http://terrillthompson.com/blog/202">Accessible Dropdown Menus</a>. One of the more accessible options discussed in Terrill's article is Yahoo's <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/node-menunav/">YUI MenuNav Node Plugin</a>.</p>
	<p>The accessible version of the AU home page uses YUI menus.</p>
</li>

<li><p><span class="label">Insufficient visual cues</span>. This page includes visual cues that 
show mouse users when they're pointing to clickable items on the page such as links. 
However, this same functionality is not provided for keyboard users, and they would arguably benefit from it even more than mouse users. Without a clear visual indication of one's current location on the page, keyboard users can have a very difficult time getting their bearings as they tab through links and controls.</p>

	<p>Visual cues for mouse users is typically provided in CSS using the selector <span class="code">a:hover</span>. The same visual cues can be replicated for keyboard users by using the selectors <span class="code">a:focus</span> (for all browsers other than Internet Explorer (IE)) and <span class="code">a:active</span> (for IE). Here's an example in CSS:</p>

	<div class="code">a:hover, a:focus, a:active {<br/>
	&nbsp;color: white;<br/>
	&nbsp;background-color: black;<br/>
	}</div>
</li>

<li><span class="label">Language not specified</span>. This page includes content in both  
English and Spanish. Leading screen readers support both of these languages (and many others), 
and can switch on the fly between languages if they know to do so. 
If they don't know to do so, an English-speaking screen reader will read the Spanish 
section using English pronunciation rules, which produces poor if not indecipherable Spanish. 
The technique for addressing this issue is to provide a <span class="attribute">lang</span> attribute 
on the <span class="element">&lt;html&gt;</span> element, with the value being the official language 
code for the primary language used in the document. For example, an English document would 
include this html tag: <span class="element">&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;</span>. 
If the web page includes content that differs from this primary language, 
the language of that section of content must also be identified in the code. For example, to markup a 
paragraph as being in Spanish, the paragraph tag would look like this:  
<span class="element">&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot;&gt;</span>
</li>

<li><span class="label">Redundant, uninformative link text</span>. This page includes two links that say &quot;Click here&quot;. Screen reader users may encounter these links out of context. For example, many screen readers include functionality that enables users to quickly generate a list of links and navigate through that list. If links are presented out of context, such as in a list of links, they should be unique, and should be meaningful in-and-of-themselves. 
</li>

<li><span class="label">Color used to communicate information</span>. In the <em>Apply Now!</em> form, required fields are marked with blue text. It is very difficult for most users to distinguish between the blue and black text. Even if the required fields were a more obvious color for the majority of users (e.g., red), many users will still be unable to distinguish between colors (e.g., blind or color-blind users, users with monochrome or color-deficient displays). Consequently they will not have access to this information. Color can be one way of communicated information, but it should also be accompanied with other means of communicating the same idea. For example, the required fields could be bold and marked with an asterisk (*), or if space permits, with &quot;(required)&quot;. Another solution is to identify required fields with aria-required=&quot;true&quot;. The <span class="attribute">aria-required</span> attribute is defined within the W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications</a> (ARIA) 1.0 specification. ARIA is designed to communicate semantic information about interactive, dynamic web content so that assistive technologies such as screen readers can provide a meaningful and effective interface through which users can interact with that content. As of November 2010, ARIA is still a draft specification, but current versions of most leading screen readers already support many of its recommendations, including <span class="attribute">aria-required</span>. On the AU Accessible Version, we have option to include the text &quot;(required)&quot; on the label for each required field, since older versions of screen readers don't support ARIA markup. 
</li> 

<li><p><span class="label">Missing accessible form markup</span>. In the <em>Apply Now!</em> form, sighted users know which labels accompany the various form fields by their position. In the first six fields the label appears immediately above the form field, and in the set of possible majors the label appears immediately after each checkbox. Although these relationships may seem apparent to sighted users, they're not so obvious to screen reader users. HTML includes markup that enables form fields and their labels to be explicitly associated with one another. If this markup is not present, screen readers have to guess which labels are associated with each field, and they don't always guess correctly. For example, some screen readers incorrectly assume the label for each checkbox is the text that immediately proceeds it, rather than the text that follows it. Therefore, a screen reader user could check the Psychology checkbox, having been erroneously informed by their screen reader that they're checking the Physics checkbox. To explicitly associate labels with form fields, each label must be marked up with the HTML <span class="element">&lt;label&gt;</span> element. The <span class="element">&lt;label&gt;</span> element has a <span class="attribute">for</span> attribute whose value matches the <span class="attribute">id</span> attribute of the associated form field.</p>
	<p>Also, when a form uses checkboxes, there are typically two pieces of critical information related to each checkbox: The label associated with that checkbox (e.g., Psychology) and the overall question or prompt (e.g., Desired major(s)). In order to explicitly communicate the relationships between all of this information, the entire set of checkboxes and labels, plus the overall question or prompt, should be wrapped in a <span class="element">&lt;fieldset&gt;</span> element, and the question/prompt should be marked up as a <span class="element">&lt;legend&gt;</span>. The individual checkbox labels should be marked up using the <span class="element">&lt;label&gt;</span> element as described above. With this accessible markup in place, screen readers can announce the overall question or prompt as the user enters the fieldset, or as he or she selects one of the checkboxes. This same markup applies to radio buttons.</p>
</li>

<li><p><span class="label">Inaccessible CAPTCHA</span>. Online forms often include images of distorted characters called CAPTCHAs ("Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"). CAPTCHAs are designed to prevent spammers and other unwanted users from filling out and submitting the form automatically. The usual method for making images accessible (alternate text) would not be feasible for CAPTCHAs since this same technique would make the images accessible to robots. The W3C published a Working Group Note in 2005 that explores the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</a> and proposed possible solutions. Several solutions have been proposed and implemented with some success:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Many sites have implemented a CAPTCHA that includes an optional audio version for users who are unable to process the visual version. An example is <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha">reCAPTCHA</a>. However, often the audio version is disproportionately more difficult to solve than the visual version. Also, this solution fails to make CAPTCHA accessible to deaf/blind users.</li>
		<li>Some sites have implemented text CAPTCHAs that ask simple logic questions. An example of this approach is <a href="http://textcaptcha.com/">textCAPTCHA</a>. This is a fully accessible solution, but as spammers' tools get smarter there may be limits to its effectiveness.</li>
		<li>WebAIM published an article with several proposed methods for attaining <a href="http://webaim.org/blog/spam_free_accessible_forms/">Spam-free accessible forms</a> without CAPTCHA. Many others have worked, and continue to work, on improving our technological ability to detect unwanted form submissions behind the scenes without burdening users.</li>
	</ul>    

	<p>For demonstration purposes, the updated AU home page provides a text CAPTCHA. This is for demonstration purposes only, and there is no actual server-side validation that alerts users if they submit the form with an incorrect security answer.</p> 	
</li>

<li><p><span class="label">Poor design of Javascript-based form validation</span>. When the user submits the form, it's validated using Javascript before the data is submitted to the survey. If the user's submission fails validation (due to required fields missing or an invalid email address), a message is displayed in a modal div, positioned in the center of the screen, with text: &quot;Your form has errors. Please correct, then resubmit.&quot; Users must click off of the error message in order to restore the window to its original state so they can proceed to fix the form errors.</p>
	<p>This feature has many problems:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Although the error message is clearly visible to sighted users, screen readers do not alert users to the fact that this message has appeared. Screen reader users may find the message eventually, but their focus is not automatically taken there. They will most likely become confused since clicking submit seems to have no effect, but they have no idea why.</li>
		<li>The error message is unclear. It states that there are errors, but does not identify what those errors were. The burden of finding the errors is left to the user, which adversely impacts usability for everyone, but can be especially challenging for screen reader users.</li>
		<li>As implemented in this case, hiding the error message is dependent on the user being able to click the screen with a mouse. If the user doesn't have or can't use a mouse, they are unable to hide the error message. Internet Explorer users experience the same problem: clicking with a mouse hides the error in all other browsers, but not in IE.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Javascript-based form validation can be a useful feature, but it should be designed in a way that considers the needs of all users, including those who can't see the error message visually, and those who are unable to use a mouse. A better design would be one in which:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the error message includes enough detail so that all users know which fields have errors.</li>
		<li>the error message is explicitly marked up with role=&quot;alert&quot; The <span class="attribute">role</span> attribute is defined within ARIA 1.0, which is described in item #10 above. If the error message is explicitly identified as having role=&quot;alert&quot;, screen readers will announce this message to users as soon as it appears, regardless of their current location on the page.</li>
		<li>the user's focus can be sent automatically to the first field on which a correction is needed</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li><span class="label">Missing ARIA landmarks</span>. ARIA (defined in items #10 and 12) includes eight so-called <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#landmark_roles">landmark roles</a>, which are specific regions of the page identified according to their function. They are: application, banner, complementary (e.g., a sidebar), contentinfo (e.g., a footer), form, main, navigation, and search. Most screen readers now support ARIA landmarks. Users can jump between landmarks on a page with a single keystroke, or can generate a list of landmarks and navigate the page using that list. This is similar in purpose to using good heading structure (see item #1), but differs in the information it communicates about the organization of the page. The accessible version of the AU Home Page uses ARIA landmarks to mark the banner, main, navigation, form, and contentinfo sections of the page. The navigation menu additionally uses <span class="attribute">aria-label</span> to clearly communicate the function of the navigation menu (in this case, <span class="code">aria-label=&quot;Main menu&quot;</span>). This supplemental label is announced by screen readers and is especially helpful for distinguishing between navigation regions if there are more than one of these regions on a page.</li>  
<li><p><span class="label">Missing accessible table markup</span>. Data tables can be challenging for screen reader users to understand, particularly if they have many columns, or a complex layout with nested rows or columns, as is the case with the AU Enrollment Trends table.  Imagine reading a table from left to right and top to bottom, with no visual access to the column headers. When you're halfway through the table, will you remember which column you're in? This is not unlike what screen reader users experience as they try to read a data table unless the table includes semantic markup that explicitly defines the relationships between the table's parts. For example, table headers should be marked up with the <span class="element">&lt;th&gt;</span> element. Also, headers should include the <span class="attribute">scope</span> attribute, which identifies whether the cell is a row header (<span class="code">&lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;</span>) or a column header (<span class="code">&lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;</span>).</p>

	<p>If the table includes nested rows or columns, the relationships between headers and cells become even more difficult to decipher. In these sorts of tables, there are typically two, three, or more headers that apply to every cell in the table. To explicitly express these relationships using HTML markup, each header needs a unique id (e.g., <span class="code">&lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot; id=&quot;col1&quot;&gt;</span>), and each data cell needs a <span class="attribute">headers</span> attribute which lists the id's of all headers that apply to that cell,  separated by a space (e.g., <span class="code">&lt;td headers=&quot;col1a col2a row1&quot;&gt;</span>). When a table includes all of this markup, screen reader users can easily ascertain their current position with a table, and their screen reader can announce all of the headers that apply to the current cell.</p>

	<p>Also, the <span class="element">&lt;table&gt;</span> element can include a <span class="attribute">summary</span> attribute, the purpose of which is to provide an overview of how the table is organized, specifically for screen reader users.</p>
</li>

<li><p><span class="label">Missing abbreviation tags</span>. Abbreviations can be difficult for all users to understand. The AU Enrollment Trends table includes a common example of how abbreviations are used in higher education. These abbreviations may be new to some users, and for all users there may be possible conflicts. For example, the abbreviation &quot;Eco&quot; could refer either to Ecological Sciences or Economics. The <span class="element">&lt;abbr&gt;</span> element (and its sister element, <span class="element">&lt;acronym&gt;</span>) should be used to identify abbreviations (or acronyms). With either of these elements, the <span class="attribute">title</span> attribute is used to spell out the full word or name. This is displayed as a tooltip to mouse users as they hover over the abbreviation, and is announced verbally to screen reader users if their screen reader is configured to support this functionality. In the Eco example, the <span class="element">&lt;abbr&gt;</span> element would be used like this:</p>
	<div class="code">&lt;abbr title=&quot;Economics&quot;&gt;Eco&lt;/abbr&gt;</div>
</li>

<li><p><span class="label">HTML fails validation</span>. The rules of markup languages like HTML were meant to be followed. If a web page uses non-standard tags or uses standard tags inappropriately, this increases the likelihood that some browsers or assistive technologies will render the page incorrectly. Therefore web pages should be checked with tools like the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a>. A check of the AU home page results in 12 errors, and detail is provided about each error. A scan of those details reveals that the 12 individual errors are actually only two errors repeated multiple times. The two errors are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Images are missing <span class="attribute">alt</span> attributes (this problem is described in Items 2 and 3 above)</li>
		<li>This page uses the <span class="element">&lt;font&gt;</span> element, which was ok in early versions of HTML, but is now obsolete.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>On the updated AU home page, the above validation errors have all been corrected. Also, the new AU home page is built using an HTML5 doctype. This allows the page to validate when using ARIA markup such as the <span class="attribute">role</span> and <span class="attribute">aria-label</span> attributes described above. Since ARIA post-dates earlier versions of HTML, it is not valid markup according to HTML validators. However, ARIA is supported by assistive technologies regardless of doctype, so we highly recommended using it even if doing so causes pages to fail validation. While it's important to use valid code in general, it's also important to know when it's ok to break the rules.</p> 
	<p>In fact, the improved AU home page has one validation error: The <span class="attribute">summary</span> attribute on tables (described in item #15) is no longer valid in HTML5. This was removed from the HTML specification with considerable controversy, and is still supported by assistive technologies even in HTML5. Therefore, this is yet another case where breaking the rules is advisable since doing so results in improved accessibility.</p>
